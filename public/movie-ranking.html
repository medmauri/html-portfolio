<h1>The best movies according to Mauricio</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King</h3>
<p>The third and final installment of the "The Lord of the Rings" saga. This one won the whooping amount of 12 Academy Awards, including best director and best movie; weirdly enough none of those awards went to individual actors or actresses.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Probably not a piece of art for real movie junkies, but for me, a 45-year-old guy who's been watching Marvel movies since the year 2001 this is nothing else but the epitome of all comic characters battle. Great Movie!</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode 6: The Return of the Jedi</h3>
<p>This movie marks the end of the first, original, and all-time best Star Wars trilogy. Watching Luke Skywalker battle and defeat his foe and father Darth Vader while his rebel friends Han, Leia, and Chewbacca fight to survive is absolutely Epic.</p>
